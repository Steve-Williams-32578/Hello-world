# Hello-world
Hello world to learn github
I have a bachelors degree in Criminology and applied to the Cybersecurity Masters program at UWF.  Criminology doesn't produce a lot of faith for the admissions board so now I am gathering knowledge from Udemy and MOOC's via EDx.  

I have always been at the edge of technology. . . Arduiono, custom quad copter builds, 3d printing, home networking and pc building.  Now it's time to build the appropriate knoweldge for a career change.  

Wish me luck.  I'm very receptive to constructive criticism.
