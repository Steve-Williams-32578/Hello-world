# Hello-world

I have a bachelors degree in Criminology and applied to the Cybersecurity Masters program at UWF.  Criminology doesn't produce a lot of faith for the admissions board so now I am gathering knowledge from Udemy and MOOC's via EDx.  

I have always been at the edge of technology. . . Arduiono, custom quad copter builds, 3d printing, home networking and pc building.  Now it's time to build the appropriate knoweldge for a career change.  

Wish me luck.  I'm very receptive to constructive criticism.  

Update Dec 9,2021:

I have found the intry process to my local college to be ridiculously arduous.  Having come from a proper university (Florida State University), I figure I will just continue to hobby my way thru my education.  I've taken up an a few courses on Udemy and other similar websites.  I've completed The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp and am currently enjoying The Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass.

My hope is to complete this course then get my own app listed on the google play store.  It will be a simple calculator; I'll make it free and open source mostly likely.  I hope you find it on my public github pages soon.
